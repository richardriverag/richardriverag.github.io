Currently, I am Professor in Computer Security at 
[Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional](https://fis.epn.edu.ec/) (EPN) in the Department of Informatics and Computer Science. 
 in Quito, Ecuador. 
And Lecturer in the [Master in Security and Privacy](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/ciberseguridad-privacidad/presentacion) at the
 [Univetsitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/es/index.html).
I got my Ph.D in Software, Systems and Computing
from [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://dssc.fi.upm.es/index.php) (UPM) and the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/).
I was advised by Professor [Juan Caballero](https://software.imdea.org/people/juan.caballero/).
Prior to my Ph.D I received a Software Engineer 
degree from EPN in Quito, Ecuador,
a M.Sc. in Software and Systems from UPM and a 
M.Sc. in Computer Security from Universidad Internacional de la Rioja (UNIR). 

My research interests are focused on Computer Security and Program Analysis.
Currently, I develop techniques and tools for programs analysis, detection and classification of
malicious software. Other areas of interest are machine learning, software engineering,
data science and cyber-espionage.
